### Task

The purpose of this task was to use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing an analysis completed on the weather data of 500+ cities.

The website needed to contain 7 pages:
* A landing page which gives an explanation of the project and links to each visualisation. (Note: the landing page is also known as the index page)
* 4 x visualisation pages that displays the graph selected with a short paragraph of findings. Each page needs to contain links to the other visualisations.
* A comparison page that displays all graphs on the same page.
* A data page that contains a table displaying the data used to create the visualisations.

Each page needs to have a navigation bar that consists of a drop down menu that contains links to each visulaisation, a clickable link to the comparison page and data page, and a clickable button to the home summary page. 

Each page needs to be responsive meaning that it needs to be able to be viewed on smaller screens.

### Method

To complete this task I started by choosing a theme from Bootswatch to make the site unique and challenge myself to get creative. I ended up choosing the "Superhero" theme as the colors went well with what was used in the visualisations.

Once the theme was downloaded, it was saved as a css file and added into the github project file. This css file contains the default colors of the them and is used along with another style.css file that I have personalised.

The first step was creating the nav bar that will be used on all 7 web pages.

The base nav bar code was taken from Bootstrap and then modified to include the required text, link references and positioning.

Next a grid was created (using Bootstrap base code) to display a summary picture in one half and links to the visualisations in the other. 
I set the columns to "lg" as I found this worked best for the theme and viewing in a smaller screen.

The visualisation pages were created next. I opted to use 11 of the 12 grid spaces as I found using all 12 not as visually appealing.
Another grid was used, 1 taking up 8 spaces and the other taking up 3 spaces.
The big grid space contained a big image of the graph being reviewed and a short paragraph detailing findings.

The smaller grid section on the visualisation page contained links to the other visualisations.
I also added in a "Next" button for an alternate easy navigation through the graph images.
