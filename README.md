### Task

The purpose of this task was to use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing an analysis completed on the weather data of 500+ cities.

The website needed to contain 7 pages:
* A landing page which gives an explanation of the project and links to each visualisation. (Note: the landing page is also known as the index page)
* 4 x visualisation pages that displays the graph selected with a short paragraph of findings. Each page needs to contain links to the other visualisations.
* A comparison page that displays all graphs on the same page.
* A data page that contains a table displaying the data used to create the visualisations.

Each page needs to have a navigation bar that consists of a drop down menu that contains links to each visulaisation, a clickable link to the comparison page and data page, and a clickable button to the home summary page. 

Each page needs to be responsive meaning that it needs to be able to be viewed on smaller screens.
